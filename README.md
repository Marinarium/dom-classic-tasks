# DOM - classic tasks

There are typical tasks of working with DOM.

### Change DOM element properties
**Situation 1:** An user fills out a form. 
The user can choose only one option.
If the user choose an option "Other", 
a textarea will be editable. 
By default, the textarea is disabled.  

**Script:** [link][1]  
**View:** [link][2]

**Situation 2:** We have internal navigation (a list of links / bookmarks). 
We need to save space on the page. Switching between bookmarks is performed by JavaScript code.
If we click on a link, we will show an appropriate section and we will hide others.

**Script:** [link][3]  
**View:** [link][4]

**Situation 3:** More information can be shown and then hidden again.

**Script:** [link][5]  
**View:** [link][6]
